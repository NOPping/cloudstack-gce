# Google Compute Engine Interface For Cloudstack

## Proposal

This project aims to provide a new compute API interface for Apache Cloudstack that is compatible with Google Compute Engine [GCE](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine). GCE is Google's Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) compute service that competes with Amazon Web Services EC2. In short, this is a mapping of the GCE API [reference](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/) and the CloudStack [API](http://cloudstack.apache.org/docs/api/index.html)

## Implementation

The GCE APIs for Cloudstack is supplied as a layer over the current Cloudstack API. The given application will take in a GCE based API request, pass it over to the Cloudstack API, get the required data and return it in a suitable format.

It is written in Python, using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to expose a GCE compliant REST API. Requests, Pycrypto, Pyopenssl and Flask-sqlachemy are dependencies. A custom version of pyoauth2 is included in the source.

In this first early release, the following GCE categories are implemented:
- disks
- firewalls
- images
- instances
- machine type
- global operations
- project
- zones

Caveat: There exists some semantic differences between the two APIs, for example between the concept of zones and regions, projects and domains. This project does a best effort attempt at creating a usable GCE interface to a CloudStack cloud but it may not fit every CloudStack deployment.

##Installation

#Developers

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/NOPping/cloudstack-gce.git

Install the package

    python ./setup.py install

This will install a `gcecloudstack` binary in your path. Check the `gcecloudstack/data/config.cfg` and enter the endpoint of your cloud.

Install [gcutil](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/gcutil/) 

gcloud comes with a self-signed certificate for the local endpoint `gcecloudstack/data/server.crt`, copy the certificate to the gcutil certificates file `gcutil/lib/httplib2/httplib2/cacerts.txt`

At this stage your CloudStack apikey and secretkey need to be entered in the gcutil auth_helper.py file at `gcutil/lib/google_compute_engine/gcutil/auth_helper.py`
This is far from ideal and we opened a featur request with google to pass the `client_id` and `client_secret` as options to gcutil, hopefully future release of gcutil will allow us to do so.

Start gcloud:

    gcecloudstack

Use gcutil with the following parameters (an alias can be useful):

    gcutil --authorization_uri_base=https://localhost:5000/oauth2 --auth_host_name=127.0.0.1 --auth_host_port=9999 --auth_local_webserver=true --api_host="https://localhost:5000/" --fetch_discovery=true

gcutil will issues requests to the local Flask application, get an OAuth token and then issue requests to your CloudStack endpoint

#Users

You can grab the package from Pypi

    pip install gcloud

Then follow the same instructions as the Developers.


##Usage

With a small convenient bash script like this:

    #!/bin/bash

    echo $*

    gcutil --authorization_uri_base=https://localhost:5000/oauth2 --auth_host_name=127.0.0.1 --auth_host_port=9999 --auth_local_webserver=true --api_host="https://localhost:5000/" --fetch_discovery=true $*

You can start issuing standard gcutil commands:

    gcloud --project foobar listmachinetype

##Trouble shooting

If you encounter authentication/authorization issues, clean up your gcutil authentication information `rm -rf ~/.gcutil_auth`, make sure that you set your `client_id` and `client_secret` in `gcutil/lib/google_compute_engine/gcutil/auth_helper.py`
